to entertain the reader by avoiding the monotony of unin-
terrupted narrative, but rather to secure an opportunity for
the portrayal of character and the representation of opposing
motiveS. In this way the anti-Roman view could be pre·
sented without the risk of appearing unpatriotic. Livy's
native tale-nt, as well as his training, was that of a rhetorician,
fand no part of his work has, either in ancient or modern l
{timeffi aroused greater admiration than the speecheS. In- s '

· deed‚ during* the empire, collections of them were made for ¹

ῗ use in the rhetorical school& The substance of a speech is J
frequently taken from one of Livy's sourceS, but the devel-
opment of it is all his own. '

As illustrations of the skill with which a speech may be
made to illuminate the narrative, the following are worthy
of special study: XXII. 25, an attack upon the Fabian
policy3 XXIII. 12-13, speech of Hann0, giving an admira-
ble representation of the secret of Roman success; XXVII.
,40-44, contrast between the policy of Fabius and of Scipio; ,'
XXX. 30-31, the interview between Scipio and Hannibal. ·

VII. THE TmRD DECADE

The theme of the third decade, from which the selections
in this edition have been taken, is the second Punic War,
or, as the Romans properly called it, the war with Han-
nibal. Involuntarily, perhaps», Livy has made Hannibal Ὗ
the hero of the great tragedy, the development of which he
relates with great dramatic power. Through the entire
story of the war, the interest centers in Hannibal, while his
antagonists appear in but a reflected light. “ From begin-
ning to end Hannibal is the pivot about which all else re·
volves. Every maneuver in these seventeen years is trace-
able directly to what Hannibal willed or did. He was not

, only pivot but mainspring of the whole movement3 to
study him is to study the second Punic War.'' ²
