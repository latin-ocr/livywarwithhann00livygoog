G PREFACE

The text is in the main that of the Mfiller-Weissenborn
Teubner edition. However‚ the use of italicised and brack-
eted words has been avoided, as any indications of textual
difficulties add unnecessarily to the bui-dens of the younger
students. In 21. 3. 1, where the manuscript reading is
doubtful, Wfflfflin has been followed, as also in 21. 44. 6
and 21. 56. 8.

Grateful acknowledgement is due to Professors H. W.
Johnson of Indiana University and O. F. Long of North-
western University, who have read the notes both in manu-
script and proof and have made many val uable suggestions
