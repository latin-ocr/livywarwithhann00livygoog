PREF ACE

The present volume is the outcome of the editor's con-
viction, after several years' experience in the class-mom, that
the student’s first acquaintance with Livy should be through
selections characterized by variety and interest, rather than
the continuous narrative of one or two bookS. To this form
of presentation no part of Livy's history lends itself more
readily than the story of the war with Hannibal, with its
dramatic situations and the intensely human interest in the
fortunes of its protagonist. While the scholar may miss in
this plan the opportunity to study closely Livy's methods
of historical composition, the young student will enjoy the
. satisfaction of following Livy’s vivid story to its end. ,

In the preparation of the commentary the one aim has
been brevity and elearness: the notes have been written for
the student, not for the instructor, and therefore avoiding
all display οξ erudition, seek to give only what is necessary
for the andex-standing of the text. Few grammar references
have been included since it has seemed better, particularly .
in view of the number of grammars employed in preparatory
work, simply to state the principle involved. The tenninol-
ogy is in the main that of the Hale-Buck Latin Grammar.
While the leading editions in English and German of the
first two books have been consulted, the Miiller-Weissenborn
edition and Dr. Fiigner’s Des Titus Livius Rbmische
Geschichte have been of especial service.
