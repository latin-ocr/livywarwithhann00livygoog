her enemieS. Ν evertheleSS, he is not often intentionally
unfair3 he sometimes severely censures the Romans and he
can at times do justice to their foes, As we shall see, he is
not entirely under the influenoe of the traditional Roman ,
conception of Hannibal, but, almost in spite of himself, ί

and, unlike Livy, understood the importance of studying
topography and the plans of battles. As an illustration of
his interest in the latter subject, it is said that he made a ,Α
visit to the AIPS, in order to determine the route followed
