8 · TITUS LIVIUS

his memory in the sixteenth century gives testimony to the
affection and gratitude of his native city.

II. H1s Hls‘ronY

In his early life, Livy wrote treatises on philosophy and
rhetorio, which have not survived. His one extant work is
the History of Rome, and of this we must regret the loss of .
more than three-fourthS‚ including portions that would
prove of the greatest interest and importance.

III. Trrm

The oldest manuscripts give, as the only title of the history,

Titi Livi Ab Urbe Condita Libri. In one passage (XLIII.
13. 2.), Livy himself refers to his work as Annales·

IV. EXTENT

Livy’s design, as he says in his preface, was to write the
complete history of the Roman people from the founding
of the city to his own time, i.e., a period of more than seven
hundred years. The work is known to have consisted of at
least one hundred and forty-two bookS, coming down as far ’
as the death of Drusus in 9 ΒΑ). Some scholars have sup-
posed that he intended to extend the history to the death of
AugustuS‚ making the total number of books one hundred
and fifty, but that· this design was interrupted by death.
The history must originally have been published‘ serially,
perhaps in decades, or groups of ten books each.

The following portioris are extant: the first decade, which
begins with the landing of Aeneas in Latium and extends to
the end of the Samnite War in 293 13.c.; books XXI-XLV,¹
which cover a period of a little more than fifty yearS, from
the beginning of the war with Hannibal to the victory of
Aemilius Paulus over King Perseus (167 13.c.). It is thus
seen that there is no opportunity to study Livy's treatment

² Books XLI and XLV are not complete.
