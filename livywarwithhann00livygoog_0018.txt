12 TITUS LIVIUS

Not only do the dramatic possibilities in the story appeal l

the war, “the most memorable ever waged.'' Its issue a)
was not merely the temporary triumph of Rome or Carthage,

1893.

Hannibal, William O’Connor MorriS, New York, 1897.

Hannibal, Theodore Ayrault Dodge, Houghton, Miffiin δι
C0., Boston, 1896.

{from Ciceronian standardS. His language belongs rather to .
