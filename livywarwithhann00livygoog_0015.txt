of the events of his own time or of the generation preceding

him3 his account of the Civil War and of the establishment
of the empire would be of the greatest value to the historian
and at the same time would be of assistance in forming an

known to us only through the Periochae‚ or summaries made
by later grammarians.

To the Roman, history was a department of literature
rather than a science. It would be a grave injustice to Livy
to criticise his work from the present-day scientific point of

⁸ view. BesideS, the field which he covered was so vast that, . ’

in the absence of the resources for investigation at the dis-
posal of the modern historian, a detailed study of any par-
, ticular period was for him impossible.
·’ Livy's purpose in writing, as he states it in his preface‚
was ethica13 to him history was a means of teaching by '²
example. “Ad illa mihi pro se quisque acriter intendat-
animum, quae vita, qui mores fuerint. per quos viros qui-
busque artibus domi militiaeque et partum et auctum im-
perium sit.—Hoc illud est praecipue in cognitione rerum
salubre ac frugiferum, omnis te exempli documenta in
illustri posita monumento intueri: inde tibi tuaeque rei pub-
licae quod imitere capiaS, inde foedum inceptu, foedum
exitu quod viteS.'' ¹

Inspired as he was by patriotic motives in writing, it is
only natural that he should tell his story from the point of
view of his countrymen‚ extolling Rome and disparaging: ’

¹ “These are the subjects to which in my view the reader should give care-
tul attention: the lite ot the peop1e‚ their character, through what leaders and
by what qualities at home and abroad empire was gained and extended.”
“This is especially helpful and profitable in the study ot history, that you
have in a conspicuous record examples ot every sort from which to select
ior yourselr and your state that which you should imitate, that which s
diss-racemi in its beginning, disgracetul in its issue, you should avoid.”
